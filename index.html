        <p>
           The Choose my Owwn Adventure project looks kind of like a video game. Where the choices you make determine
          wher you go. I made the based on where i live and my neighborhood. The people in the game are also
          based on people i know in real life, like my mom and my neighbor for example.

        <p> We made business cards using CSS to design the style for our cards. Most of the wording and placement 
          was done through CSS. And the pictrues that i used to put in the back were made by CSS as well!
